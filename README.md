A skeleton for creating applications with [CakePHP](https://cakephp.org) 3.x.

The framework source code can be found here: [cakephp/cakephp](https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp).

## Installation

1. Download [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md) or update `composer self-update`.

You can now either use your machine's webserver to view the default home page, or start
up the built-in webserver with:

```bash
bin/cake server -p 8765
```

Then visit `http://localhost:8765` to see the welcome page.

## Configuration

Copy the file `config/app.default.php` to `config/app.php` and setup the `'Datasources'` and any other
configuration option.

## Database installation

Execute `bin/cake migrations migrate` to populate the database. You can also run this command if you
upgrade the pool code and it will automatically apply the changes to your existing database.
